<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [x] Disable game board after a player wins: once a player wins, the game board should be disabled and no further moves should be allowed
- [ ] Make it responsive: the game board should adjust to the screen size, and it should be possible to play on a mobile device
- [x] Add a "restart" button: when clicked, the game board should be cleared and the game should start over
- [ ] Add a "score" feature: keep track of the number of wins for each player
- [ ] Add a "play against the computer" feature: the computer should make random moves

See the [open issues](https://github.com/jrparente/mit-pro-tic-tac-toe/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
